Notes from Mandatory explanation

Create a website that docs what we have learned in NodeJS
- Mostly for our own use, to remind us for later use
- No req for hosting - just do localhost

Deadline and form
- before March 21st 23:59
- Fronter with zip or github with checkout 

Requirements
- Styling
    - In segments not just one long html page
    - can be different pages, dropdowns or whatever
- Use JQuery or DOM for UX
- No Webframeworks, but BootStrap is allowed
    - Needs to have styling
- Terminal commands
    - nodemon app.js
    - node app.js
    - git commands
- Code snippets in the explanation 
    - just basic snippets, but some
    - bonus if nice styling
- All tools we've used and explain them
- Theory we've touched upon
    - call backs
    - methods are first class citizens

Bonus
- research fx 
    - difference between let and const
    - garbage collection
    - something new entirely 
    - type coercion
